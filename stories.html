        <p>When we first met Brian Ontiri in the backstreets of Nairobi, he didn't even have a shirt to his name. A young man who had been lucky to read and complete his Secondary School education, tragedy had struck when he cleared school.</p>
        <p>His family was snatched from him; an unseen turn in God's Plan.</p>
        <p>With no relatives to speak of, he fell into despair when their family home in the middle-class neighbourhood of South C was snatched by debt collectors. This left
        him destitute and lost... Struggling to eat. In his words, "People are heartless. If I ever thought that before, now I am certain."</p>

        <p>Joan Kimeu had never had an easy life.</p>
        <p>She was born in the huge slums of Kibera, Nairobi and her mother died from birth complications. An aunt took young Joan in and all seemed well, until, when she was 6 years old, her aunt was murdered in a robbery gone bad.</p>
        <p>After two hellish years suffering abuse at the hands of her bereaved uncle, she ran away and found herself trapped in the city.</p>
        <p>Despite her situation, she still dreams of becoming a lawyer someday.</p>
