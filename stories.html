        <p>When we first met Moffat Githinji in the backstreets of Nairobi, he didn't even have a shirt to his name. A young man who had been lucky to read and complete his Secondary School education, tragedy had struck when he cleared school.</p>
        <p>His family was snatched from him; an unseen turn in God's Plan.</p>
        <p>With no relatives to speak of, he fell into despair when their family home in the middle-class neighbourhood of South C was snatched by debt collectors. This left
        him destitute and lost... Struggling to eat. In his words, "People are heartless. If I ever thought that before, now I am certain."</p>

        <p>Joan Kimeu had never had an easy life.</p>
        <p>She was born in the huge slums of Kibera, Nairobi and her mother died from birth complications. An aunt took young Joan in and all seemed well, until, when she was 6 years old, her aunt was murdered in a robbery gone bad.</p>
        <p>After two hellish years suffering abuse at the hands of her bereaved uncle, she ran away and found herself trapped in the city.</p>
        <p>Despite her situation, she still dreams of becoming a lawyer someday.</p>

        <p>Abdikadir Abdalla had never known another home away from the streets.</p>
        <p>His mother had him in the streets and as such, it was the only home he knew.</p>
        <p>Life was cruel to him and his four brothers so he turned to a life of petty crime to support his adhesives addiction which he developed at the age of 12.</p>
        <p>He was arrested once and did a prison bid for 3 long years, but in his words, "Life was better in prison."</p>
        <p>When he got out last year, he went back home: The Streets of Nakuru.</p>

        <p>A one-time model, Priscilla Cherono soon got caught up in a life that wasn't hers. A friend of hers introduced her to heroin and she was never the same.</p>
        <p>Soon she couldn't afford rent and was forcibly vacated from her plush residence at Nairobi's Uptown neighbourhood of Milimani.</p>
        <p>By this point in her life, her mother, a single parent, had passed on; Priscilla never even attended the funeral.</p>
        <p>She became a sex-worker to support her heroin habit, but it was a shortlived line of work.</p>
        <p>With nowhere to go, and no-one to turn to she found herself homeless and eating out of garbage cans.</p>

        <p>Then he fell mysteriously sick and had to be admitted in hospital. Soon thereafter, his wife left him with their young son and teamed up with a lawyer to get a divorce and milk the sick
        man of all his was worth. The amount of wealth he was left with was eaten away by the high medical bills.</p>
        <p>Then as mysteriously as it had come, the disease left him.</p>
        <p>A despondent Bobby took to drinking and that was the last nail to the coffin that his poverty.</p>
        <p>He did a few odd jobs for a living but disaster knocked once more.</p>
        <p>He was hit by a car and rendered lame. No one helped.</p>
        <p>He was stranded.</p>
